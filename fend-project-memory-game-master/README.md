# Memory Game Project

##Installation
To get started, download zip file or open from git project link:... . Please double click "index.html " in any browser. We recommend Chrome browser.

To play the game, click 2 cards at a time. If the cards match, they will remain flipped. Your star rating will decrease with the number of moves it takes to complete the game. The timer will measure the seconds necessary to finish. How many moves will it take you? Go ahead and try!

##Resources

I have used several resources as general inspiration :  
I started by watching the webinar of Mike Wales, found at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y
I was also inspired by the webinars of Ryan Waite, starting with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oECVwum-7Zc I used Matthew Cranford's tutorials as starting point(part 1-3), even though I switched to a different approach afterwards: https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/ I used the modal explanation of Matthew Cranford https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-7-making-a-modal/ and the example at : https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp

For detailed attribution, I have included specific functions/ideas at the correct place in the code, especially in the Java Script file.
## Thank you for taking the time to review my project!
