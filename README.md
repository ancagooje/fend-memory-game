##Resources

I have used several resources as general inspiration, found at this resource list: https://www.diigo.com/outliner/fii42b/Udacity-Memory-Game-Project?key=dwj0y5x9cw

I started by watching the webinar of Mike Wales, found at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y

I was also inspired by the webinars of Ryan Waite, starting with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oECVwum-7Zc 
I used Matthew Cranford's tutorials as starting point(part 1-3), even though I switched to a different approach afterwards:
https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/ 
I used the modal explanation of Matthew Cranford https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-7-making-a-modal/ and the example at :  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp


For detailed attribution, I have included specific functions/ideas at the correct place in the code, especially in the Java Script file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
